                        New <span>blood</span> joins this earth<br>
                        And quickly he's subdued<br>
                        Through constant pained disgrace<br>
                        The young boy learns their rules<br>
        
                        With time, the child draws in<br>
                        This whipping boy done wrong<br>
                        Deprived of all his thoughts<br>
                        The young man struggles on and on he's known<br>
                        A vow unto his own<br>
                        That never from this day<br>
                        His will they'll take away<br>
        
                        What I've felt<br>
                        What I've known<br>
                        Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
                        Never be<br>
                        Never see<br>
                        Won't see what might have been
